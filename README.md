# gym-bot

gym bot was something I made to help sign up for gym sessions at school while it was restricted during COVID. Sessions were really hard to come by because people would hound them as soon as they opened up. And even if they were open, they were at random, sporadic times. I built this to get some routine in my sessions while also guaranteeing I had them. 

It's pretty simple, it goes and signs up for the session that is 48 hours in advance, which is when the school would open it up. The code is not that great and probably not applicable anywhere else, but it might be useful for someone to look at if they're learning how to use selenium. It gave me some good use.
